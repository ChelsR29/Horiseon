# Horiseon

## Description

The objective of this project was to take an existing starter code and refactor it. This project was built to further my understanding of HTML and CSS. More specifically, how to put HTML in a semantic structure and consolidate selectors/properties in CSS. I was able to get all links in the application to work functionally, provide a descriptive title, add alt attributes to img elements and seqeuntially order the headings.
